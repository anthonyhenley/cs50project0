This is a personal website about Cats.

Yes, cats. The animal, not the musical turned movie.

I was inspired by CS50's liberal use of cats throughout the course, which reminds me of the late Winston Samuel-Henley, a Russian Blue who was a close family member until his passing in 2016. My partner and I have been discussing the adoption of a new family member, so this site is dedicated to my initial reasearch into different cat breeds.
