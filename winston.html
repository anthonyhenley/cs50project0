            Winston Samuel-Henley, the son of Leo the Lion and Tony the Tiger, was born on April 1, 1994 in the parking lot of the GM Canada plant in Oshawa, Ontario.
            <br>
            This is a little-known fact, since he is grey in colour and does not resemble a lion nor a tiger at all. His birth parents quickly abandoned him to pursue their Hollywood careers at MGM and Kellogg's, respectively, leaving Winston in the care of the Humane Society of Durham Region. He was promptly adopted by the Samuel family, by loving parents Cathy and Nelson.
            <br>
            Over the years, Winston was quite the cuddly fella, but developed an angry tick which cat psycologists attributed to beng ditched when he was a kitten. In 2003, Anthony Henley, a hater of all cats, met Winston for the first time. Being a cat, Winston couldn't stay away from the person who wanted nothing to do with him and developed a close bond over a long period of forced interaction.
            <br>
            In 2007, the Samuels adopted Lucy, a chocolate lab. While Lucy loved to play with Winston, the love was not mutual. Inevitably, Winston would move in with Aaron and Anthony to escape the madness.
            <br>
            Upon finishing university, the trio of Aaron, Anthony and Winston moved to Toronto, Ontario to pursue larger aspirations. They lived happily in a cramped condo in the trendy neighbourhood of King West, where Winston would seekout the sunniest spots and watch the African Dwarf Frogs longingly as they swam in acrobatic unison for days on end. This is, until he finally mustered up the courage to swat them out of the small aquarium and lick their poisonous skin while Aaron and Anthony were out for groceries. He didn't successfully eat them, but got enough of a taste to cause a seriously upset stomach and create a huge mess.
            <br>
            Later that year, Aaron and Anthony travelled to Las Vegas to visit Leo the Lion at her retirement cage at the MGM Grand Resort & Casino, to pass on the news that Winston was planning a tell-all expos√© in order to profit off of the sad, sad story of being deserted at such a young age and how he overcame it at all odds.
            <br>
            Winston never did develop his literary skills, so the book was never released. He spent his remaining years with proud fathers Aaron and Anthony in an even more cramped condo on the Toronto Waterfront, eating as much Fancy Feast as his cracked teeth would allow.
            <br>
            Winston passed away at the ripe old age of 22 years old in June 2016. He haunts the Samuel-Henley house to this day.
